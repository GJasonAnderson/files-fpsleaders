  <h1>Week 2 - Why We Preach</h1>
  
  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> God’s word is powerful and shapes our lives and the lives of those around us</p>

  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Understand and apply God’s word to your life to reach people for Christ</p>

  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Hebrews 4:12 and Jeremiah 23:29</p>

  <p><b>Small Group Tip:</b> Don’t forget that you have access to the “throw and tell conversation starter ball” if you get done early or want to take a break during the lesson.</p>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>We need to understand that God’s word is a firm foundation for our lives. If we allow Him, God will help us determine what His word is asking us to do and how to do it. God’s Word can impact our lives and others when we read it, hear it, and share it.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>FIRST, open up your group by talking about the past week, and what has happened in student’s lives.</p>

  <p>THEN, ask the Ice Breaker Question:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>If someone gave you the board game MONOPOLY with no instructions, and asked you to play it, how do you think it would go?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The bible is like an instruction manual to our lives. Have you ever wondered why our lives and the lives of those around us seem to be like chaos sometimes? It is the end result of not having an obedient relationship with Jesus Christ. Just like Monopoly with no instructions, our lives without God’s word will be in disorderly. We must first apply scripture to our lives before we try to preach it to others.</p>
  
  <p>PRAY before starting your group session, asking God to reveal the truth and power of His word.</p>

  <h3>Lesson</h3>
  
  <p>Ask the students to talk about what comes to mind when they hear about the Bible. Then, disucuss the following question.</p>
  
  <p class="question">How does God’s Word help us grow?</p>
  
  <p class="answer">It reveals truth; it provides knowledge; it refreshes our spirits; it gives us hope.</p>

  <p>Have a student read Hebrews 4:12. (Check out the New Living Translation (NLT) or God’s Word Translation (GW) for an easy to understand translation)</p>
  
  <p class="question">What does this verse compare the Bible to?</p>
  
  <p class="question">Why does scripture compare God’s word to a sword?</p>
  
  <p class="answer">A sword cuts through material that is softer than it. (God’s word CUTS through the hardness of hearts because it is stronger!)</p>

  <p class="question">How does the Bible “expose” our thoughts and desires? (NLT translation)</p>

  <p class="answer">When we read scripture, many times it will directly correlate with what is going on in our hearts, and in our lives.  Also, when we see that our lives differ from what is noted in scripture, we are convicted by the Holy Spirit.</p>

  <h3>Life Application</h3>
  
  <p>Now that we have discussed in depth what scripture says about God’s word, let us place our confidence in His ability to change our lives and the people around us, too!  Stay in God’s word to keep your sword sharpened! Just like a warrior in battle, you don’t want to face your enemy with a dull sword!</p>
  
  <p>Reading and Hearing God’s Word - Let’s be honest. Sometimes it can be hard to stay focused during the message. For students, they have theirs phones in their laps, their friends next to them, and a random thought about homework they forgot popping up in their minds. However, these distractions don’t have to win.</p>

  <p class="question">What is one step you can take tonight to focus on the message instead of the things happening around you?</p>

  <p class="answer">Sit by friends who won’t distract you, turn your phone on airplane mode, take notes, etc.</p>

  <p class="question">We don’t have to stop reading and hearing about the Bible when we go home. What is one step you can take this week to read God’s Word?</p>
  
  <p class="answer">Sign up for a plan on the Bible app (YouVersion has a lot of great plans that are short and simple). Start a verse of the day group message with your small group, read one chapter from the book of John, etc.</p>
  
  <p class="answer">Challenge: This week, read the passage that your student pastor uses during his sermon tonight. You can read small portions of it or even consider memorizing a verse from it.</p>
  
  <p>Sharing God’s Word – God’s Word doesn’t stop with us. It is meant to be shared with those around you after you experience it yourself.</p>
  
  <p class="question">How can you use the Bible to encourage your friends?</p>

  <p class="question">Is there anyone specifically to whom God is calling you to share His word?</p>

  <hr>

  <h3>Take It Out</h3>
  
  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Encourage students to share things that are really impacting them personally. Pray specifically for the group, and the effect they are going to have on the world around them.</p>
  
  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
