  <h1>Week 4 - Why We Worship</h1>
  
  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> Worship is our response to God.</p>

  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Love God by worshipping God.</p>

  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Colossians 3:2</p>

  <p><b>Small Group Tip:</b> Don’t forget that you have access to the “throw and tell conversation starter ball” if you get done early or want to take a break during the lesson.</p>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>Have you noticed any trends as you watch your students worship? Do they look confused? Do they mimic the 9th grader standing in front of them? Do they sing along? Do they scan the room? Do they play on their phone? Tonight we want you to enter into a discussion with your 6th graders about why we worship and how we worship. Often times, their distraction isn’t because they don’t want to worship. It is simply that they don’t understand what worship is.</p>
  
  <p>So, what is worship? Worship is our response to God. Worship is one way we can love God by focusing on who He is and praising Him for it. Worship can take on many forms. But, tonight we are going to talk about the corporate worship that takes place here at FPS.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p class="question">What is your favorite thing to do?</p>

  <p>Whatever students spend the most time on is what they worship most. Usually these things are earthly things: cell phones, social medias, school, etc. Now, these things aren’t bad things. In fact, some of them are even really good things. But, as a leader you know how quickly things can get in-between you and Jesus.</p>

  <p>PRAY as you begin your small group time that your students would be encouraged to love Jesus by worshiping Jesus.</p>

  <h2>Lesson</h2>
  
  <p>To kick off the lesson for tonight, have a student read Colossians 3:2 aloud.</p>

  <p>Colossians 3:2 – “Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.”</p>

  <p class="question">What do you think the author was talking about when they said “things above?”</p>

  <p class="answer">Consider having students read The Message version. It summarizes this passage in a way that is easier to understand.</p>

  <p class="answer">To think about things above, means to think about things the way Jesus calls us to. Let’s say your student is in a fight with their sibling. When they think about things as Jesus would they can make a few conclusions: Jesus loves me even though me and my sibling are fighting, Jesus wants me to forgive them, and we can get along again with Jesus’ help.</p>

  <p class="question">What does this verse mean when it says “earthly things?”</p>

  <p class="answer">Earthly things are the things around us, including: friends, social media, school, family, sports, popularity, etc.</p>

  <p class="question">Which one do you focus on the most? Things above or earthly things?</p>

  <p class="answer">Encourage your students that you aren’t just looking for the “good church answer.” Sure, we wish they focused on Jesus more than anything else, but that’s probably not their reality.</p>

  <p class="question">Do you think it’s bad to focus on other things besides Jesus? Why or why not?</p>

  <p class="answer">There are tons of good things we can focus on. In fact, it’s not wrong to focus on other things at all. But, Jesus just asks us to not make those things greater than He is in our minds. Our students can’t avoid thinking about school. Instead, as they grow and mature, Jesus can become their filter through the way they think about school.</p>

  <p>During this series, we are going to be talking about worship. Before going any farther, let’s make sure everyone understands what worship is.</p>

  <p class="question">In one or two words, what is worship?</p>

  <p>Worship is our way of responding to God. When we worship God, we are loving God. When students love something, whether that be their dog, sibling (sometimes), parent, or sport they show their love for it by what they think, do and say. When we love something, we know it and so do others.</p>

  <p class="question">What are some ways you can worship?</p>

  <p class="answer">While the obvious answer to your students may be singing, there are tons of other ways. This can include writing, playing an instrument, talking about Jesus with friends, etc. Encourage your students to think outside of the box with this question.</p>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  
  <p>Worship at FPS is a whole different experience for our 6th graders. So, we want to meet them right where they are. What do you want for your 6th graders to experience during worship? Spend a minute or two telling your 6th graders what you hope they get to experience as they worship Jesus at FPS. Maybe, one hope is that even for just a moment they are able to focus on Jesus when life is crazy and chaotic. Maybe, one hope is that worship is their escape from everything that seems to be going wrong in their life as they turn to Jesus.</p>

  <p>We worship things because we attribute some sort of worth to them. Do you ever think about why you worship what you worship? Now, ask the following question to close out small group.</p>

  <p class="question">We have so many reasons to worship Jesus. What is one reason you want to worship Jesus?</p>

  <p class="answer">Example answers: He loves me, He died for me, He is the greatest of all, etc.</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  
  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Pray that students would experience the love of Jesus as they worship Him.</p>
  
  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
