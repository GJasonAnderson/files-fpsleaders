  <h2>Salvation Follow-Up</h2>
  <p>Did any of your students make a decision to follow Jesus this weekend? If so, make sure to continue to have some follow-up conversations with them this weekend about their decision, as you encourage them and discuss any questions they may have. In those conversations, please also talk about baptism with them. If they would like to be baptized this weekend, please reach out to their parents to get permission first and let your coach know once the parents have given permission.</p>
