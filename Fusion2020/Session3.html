  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <p>Acts 2:14-21
        14 Then Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice and addressed the crowd: “Fellow Jews and all of you who live in Jerusalem, let me explain this to you; listen carefully to what I say. 15 These people are not drunk, as you suppose. It’s only nine in the morning! 16 No, this is what was spoken by the prophet Joel:
        17 “‘In the last days, God says,
            I will pour out my Spirit on all people.
        Your sons and daughters will prophesy,
            your young men will see visions,
            your old men will dream dreams.
        18 Even on my servants, both men and women,
            I will pour out my Spirit in those days,
            and they will prophesy.
        19 I will show wonders in the heavens above
            and signs on the earth below,
            blood and fire and billows of smoke.
        20 The sun will be turned to darkness
            and the moon to blood
            before the coming of the great and glorious day of the Lord.
        21 And everyone who calls
            on the name of the Lord will be saved.
        
        
        
        Acts 2:38-40
        38 Peter replied, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off—for all whom the Lord our God will call.”
        40 With many other words he warned them; and he pleaded with them, “Save yourselves from this corrupt generation.” 41 Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
        </p>

  <h2>Salvation Follow-Up</h2>
  <p>Did any of your students make a decision to follow Jesus this weekend? If so, make sure to continue to have some follow-up conversations with them this weekend about their decision, as you encourage them and discuss any questions they may have. In those conversations, please also talk about baptism with them. If they would like to be baptized this weekend, please reach out to their parents to get permission first and let your coach know once the parents have given permission.</p>
