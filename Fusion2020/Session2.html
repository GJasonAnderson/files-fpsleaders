  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <p><b>Luke 5:1-11</b> One day as Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, the people were crowding around him and listening to the word of God. <sup>2</sup>He saw at the water’s edge two boats, left there by the fishermen, who were washing their nets. <sup>3</sup>He got into one of the boats, the one belonging to Simon, and asked him to put out a little from shore. Then he sat down and taught the people from the boat.
    <br>
    <sup>4</sup>When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into deep water, and let down the nets for a catch.”
    <br>
    <sup>5</sup>Simon answered, “Master, we’ve worked hard all night and haven’t caught anything. But because you say so, I will let down the nets.”
    <br>
    <sup>6</sup>When they had done so, they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break. <sup>7</sup>So they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
    <br>
    <sup>8</sup>When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’ knees and said, “Go away from me, Lord; I am a sinful man!” <sup>9</sup>For he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken, <sup>10</sup>and so were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.
    <br>
    Then Jesus said to Simon, “Don’t be afraid; from now on you will fish for people.” <sup>11</sup>So they pulled their boats up on shore, left everything and followed him.</p>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How do you like being told to do something that you’ve already done?</li>

  <h2>Salvation Follow-Up</h2>
  <p>Did any of your students make a decision to follow Jesus this weekend? If so, make sure to continue to have some follow-up conversations with them this weekend about their decision, as you encourage them and discuss any questions they may have. In those conversations, please also talk about baptism with them. If they would like to be baptized this weekend, please reach out to their parents to get permission first and let your coach know once the parents have given permission.</p>
