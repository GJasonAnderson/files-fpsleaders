  <h2>Scripture</h2>
 
    <ul>
      <li>John 13:4-5 “so he got up from the meal, took off his outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around his waist. 5 After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.”</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>

    <li>What does integrity mean? Personally, do you think you have good integrity? When no one is looking are you always doing the right thing?</li>
    <li>Being honest, are you the type of person that cares for people? Will you help someone who needs help even if it’s uncomfortable or awkward?</li>

    <ul>
      <li>If you go the extra mile, care for people, and do what is right when no one is watching, God can use you for anything. This week, what one thing can you work on? Going the extra mile, caring for people, or having integrity?</li>
