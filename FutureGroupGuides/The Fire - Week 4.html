  <h1>Week 4 - The Fire</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How did you like this month’s series? Biggest takeaway?</li>
      <li>What are some goals you have for the month of March?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have everyone share a story about a time where they wanted something really bad, but then they discovered how much it cost.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The price of following Jesus is always worth the outcome.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Luke 14:27-28</b> And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it?</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself trying to have a relationship with God like a Burger King burger, “your way?” Explain how they can’t pick and choose parts of the Bible they don’t want to follow but once they commit to following God, it’s always His way over our way.</li>
    <li>Have you ever been frustrated because God’s plans for you were confusing and you weren’t sure that was the way you wanted to go? Explain a time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>After going through this series, what are some ways that you can live “on fire” for God? Remind them that following God isn’t always an easy life but it’s a rewarding one. Being on fire for God is ultimately going to draw people in. At this time, give some time to have students repent of their sins and pray for them and with them.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Baptism Follow-Up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you make a decision to follow Jesus for the first time at Fusion? Or maybe even tonight?</li>
    <li>Have you made that decision sometime in the past but you've never gone public by being baptized?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Baptism is our first official act of obedience as a new Christian and a super easy way to tell the world about your decision. Encourage your students to "seal the deal" and get baptized if they are a follower of Jesus!</p>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
