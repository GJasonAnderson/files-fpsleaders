  <h1><i>DNA</i> Week 2</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>How was Movement last week? What did you get out of it?</li>
      <li>What are your plans for the rest of the summer?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>In life, what do you find the hardest thing to give up is? (time, effort, money, love)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What you give is what you’ll get.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <p><b>Luke 6:38 (NIV)</b> Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>What gifts do you have that seem insignificant to you?</li>
    <li>Do you ever give something to someone hoping for something in return? Why?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How could you use the God given gifts you’ve been given this week to help someone?</li>
      <li>If someone treats you wrongly this week, what steps are you going to take to combat that?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>Pray that your students use their God given gifts how they were intended and pray that they treat everyone with grace like Jesus treats us with grace.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind your students of THE WEEKEND!</li>
  </ul>
