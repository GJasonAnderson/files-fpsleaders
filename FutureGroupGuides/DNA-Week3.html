  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <p><b>Proverbs 27:17 (NLT)</b> As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens a friend.</p>

    <p><b>Ecclesiastes 4:12 (NLT)</b> A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself facing problems alone? Explain some examples.</li>
    <li>Although being in a group can help you face problems, you have to be in the right group for your needs. What kind of groups of friends do you have? Are they supporting you or enforcing the problems you have?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What do you think would happen if you let go of the bad influences in your life and linked arms with better influences?</li>
      <li>Learning today that you can’t face your problems alone but instead have to do it with a group of people, do you think missing small group or only coming when it’s convenient is the right thing to do? Why or why not?</li>
