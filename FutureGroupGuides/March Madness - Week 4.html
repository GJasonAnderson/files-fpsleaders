  <h1>March Madness: Week 4</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose 1 or 2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What was your favorite part tonight?</li>
      <li>What is the difference between Joy and Happiness?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do you think it is important to allow God to be the source of our Joy?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>True Joy can only be found in Jesus.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>James 1:1-8 NIV</b> James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations: Greetings. Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance.  Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything.  If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you.  But when you ask, you must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind.  That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.  Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do.</li>
      <li>What does it look like to "count it all joy?"</li>
      <li>In what ways this week can we live out this verse?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What can happen if we DON'T live in joy and only happiness?</li>
    <li>What are the barriers that stand in the way of you living out true joy?</li>
    <li>What can you do this week to break down those barriers?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Challenge your students to write out the things that can become false gods in their lives and how they will remove them this week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests – it is important that your students know that you pray for them regularly!</li>
    <li>Remind them about the importance of baptism for new believers and encourage them get it scheduled for an upcoming weekend service. Attend the service with them and celebrate!</li>
    <li>Remind them about attending FP with their family this coming weekend!</li>
  </ul>
