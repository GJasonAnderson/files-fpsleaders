  <h1>Week 3 - Why We Group</h1>
  
  <p><b>What we want students to learn:</b> God’s best for you is in a small group! You were not made to do life alone!</p>

  <p><b>What we want students to do with what they've learned:</b> Students should use their life groups as a place where they can encourage others, be encouraged, and grow together. These relationships should extend beyond one night a week.</p>

  <p><b>Scripture Focus:</b> Acts 2:42-44, 46-47</p>

  <p><b>Supporting Scripture:</b> Ecclesiastes 4:9-12</p>

  <p><b>Small Group Tip:</b> Don’t forget that you have access to the “throw and tell conversation starter ball” if you get done early or want to take a break during the lesson.</p>

  <h2>The Main Point</h2>

  <p>Life is hard, and when you try to do it alone, it is even harder.  From the beginning, God realized that man was not meant to be alone. Throughout the bible, the term “one another” is used more than 50 times.  God designed us to have relationships.  We were meant to do life together, encourage each other, pray for each other, and love each other. At fpStudents, that starts with our small groups.</p>

  <h2>Ice Breaker</h2>

  <p>This week we are going to keep the ice breaker simple.  Just give each of the students a chance to talk about their week.  Either the best thing that happened, or the worst thing that happened.  Try to keep it short, and give everyone a chance to speak.  After each person finishes, ask the rest of the group how many of them knew about that event.</p>

  <p>All too often, our life groups begin and end on Wednesday night, and don’t continue throughout the week.  Tonight we are going to talk about groups, and how God intended us to encourage and support each other throughout our entire lives.</p>

  <h2>Lesson</h2>
  
  <p class="question">So far, what is your favorite part about being in a FPS small group?</p>

  <p>Have a student read Acts 2:42-44. Then ask the following questions:</p>

  <p class="question">What does fellowship mean to you?</p>

  <p class="answer">Help the students explore what the bible meant by fellowship – not just hanging out with friends.</p>

  <p class="question">According to these verses, what did these people do together?</p>

  <p class="answer">They listened to teaching together, grew together, prayed together, ate together, and worshipped God together.</p>

  <p class="question">What are some things that good friends do for each other?</p>

  <p class="answer">Good friends don’t just post pictures with each other. Good friends encourage one another and point each other back to Jesus. That is exactly what this group of believers did. They pointed each other to Jesus consistently.</p>

  <p>Now have a student read Ecclesiastes 4:9-12.  Explain to your students that we were meant to do life together, support each other and encourage each other.  Then ask the following questions:</p>

  <p class="question">Who is somebody you can rely on to help you when you fall?</p>

  <p class="question">Who in your life is encouraging you and praying for you?</p>

  <p class="question">Who are you encouraging and praying for?</p>

  <hr>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  
  <p>Now let’s go back to the verses in Acts 2 one more time.  Have a student read Acts 2:46-47, and then ask the following life application questions:</p>
  
  <p class="question">Do you think that just meeting and talking on Wednesday nights is enough? Why or why not?</p>

  <p class="question">We want our small groups to be a place where students feel safe and encouraged to talk about what is happening in their life. What is one step you all, as a group, can take to make this a safe and encouraging place?</p>

  <p class="question">How can we, as a small group, continue to support each other throughout the week?</p>

  <p class="answer">Our students live in a technologically driven world.  Brainstorm ways that your group can leverage that technology to make small group last throughout the week, not just on Wednesday night.</p>

  <h2>Closing Activity</h2>

  <p>Does your small group still have your conversation starter ball? If time allows spend the rest of group time tossing it around, having students answer questions. Great friendships aren’t just built on serious things. Having fun is one of the best parts about friendships too!</p>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  
  <p>Close small group out with prayer requests. Encourage students to share things that are really impacting them personally. Remind them that prayer requests don’t have to only happen on Wednesday nights, and that they can be praying for each other daily.</p>
  
  <p>After prayer, be sure to remind them of any upcoming group serving activities or student events and THE WEEKEND!</p>
