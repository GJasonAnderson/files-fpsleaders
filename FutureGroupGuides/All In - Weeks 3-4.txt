We Serve Others

SCRIPTURE
John 6:26-59 Because this is a long passage, we recommend looking it up on the YouVersion app on your phone and using a translation designed around easy readability, like the New Living Translation (NLT) for older students or the New International Reader’s Version (NIRV) for younger students. You could also have students take turns reading through the passage or read through it in sections.
