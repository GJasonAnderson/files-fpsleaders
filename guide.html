  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>John 14:1-7 - “Your heart must not be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in Me. <sup>2</sup> In My Father’s house are many dwelling places; if not, I would have told you. I am going away to prepare a place for you. <sup>3</sup> If I go away and prepare a place for you, I will come back and receive you to Myself, so that where I am you may be also. <sup>4</sup> You know the way to where I am going.” <sup>5</sup> “Lord,” Thomas said, “we don’t know where You’re going. How can we know the way?” <sup>6</sup> Jesus told him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me. <sup>7</sup> “If you know Me, you will also know My Father. From now on you do know Him and have seen Him.”</li>

    <li>How much time do you wast a week on stuff like Netflix or social media?</li> <li>We get to heaven through Jesus so why are we not spending more time with Him?</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Personally, what steps do you think you could take to develop heart transformation in your own life?</li>
      <li>Encourage students to take 20 minutes away from the time they would be watching Netflix or scrolling through social media to spend time with Jesus so they can help develop a strong, lasting relationship with Him.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
