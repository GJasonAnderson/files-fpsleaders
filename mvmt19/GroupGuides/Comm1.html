      <b>Ice breaker- Life is Tough!</b><br>
      Question 1 - What is a time you had to work for something and it was really difficult?<br>
      Question 2 - How did it feel that you persevered through the struggle and had victory?<br>
      Once everyone has had an opportunity to answer, share your own answers to the questions.<br>
      Host - Transitioning into the message:<br>
      Often in life we are faced with struggles! If you have been alive for longer than 5 minutes you know this!  You have to work for things and sometimes that comes with struggle and pain!  In your walk with God, however, you can choose what pain you face. You can choose the pain of obedience or the pain of regret of a wasted life!  Now you’re probably thinking, “Wow, this group just got depressing!” and at face value you would be right.  But at the end of the road if you choose to follow God this pain of obedience leads to joy!
