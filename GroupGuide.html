  <h1><i>At the Movies</i> Week 3</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?</li>

    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

      <li>Do you ever feel controlled or limited in what you can do? How so?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

      <li>Know where your power comes from.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
 
    <ul>
      <li>Ephesians 3:20 “God can do anything, you know- far more than you could ever imagine or guess or request in your wildest dreams! He does it not by pushing us around but by working within us, his Spirit deeply and gently within us.”</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Although we know our power comes from God, why do you think we act like our power came from ourselves? Why do you think we praise ourselves instead of God?</li>
    <li>Do you think you have less potential when you act like your power came from yourself?</li>
    <li>Who or what are you fighting right now? (could be family, friends, or even themselves) Why are you fighting that thing and do you blame God for fighting with that thing? Why or why not?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What steps can we take this week to praise God when we do good instead of praising ourselves?</li>
      <li>If you feel as though your life is out of control in some aspects, how can you help improve this?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
