  <h1>Week 1</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What vacations, if any, do you have planned for this summer?</li>
      <li>What are some things that you love and cherish in your life? It could be a sport, instrument, or food.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever loved something so much that the people around you never questioned if you loved it? If so, what is that one thing you love so much?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Worship is an external talk of an inward walk.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Hebrews 13:15-16 -  <sup>15</sup> “Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. <sup>16</sup> Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.”</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Do you ever find yourself putting on an act to show others that you love God? You go to small group and church on Sunday as a routine but you never truly connect to him.</li>
    <li>Do you ever give praise and worship for your accomplishments to an idol you’ve created or yourself rather than God? Why?</li>
    <li>Why do you think we can get caught up just worshiping internally rather than living a life of worship?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What are a few reasons why you personally don’t worship?</li>
      <li>How can you channel something in yourself so that you can learn to really understand God and understand why He matters to you?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>Pray specifically for the upcoming week that your students work to develop their relationship with Jesus so they can go out and build new relationships with people and bring people to Jesus.</li>
    <li>After prayer, be sure to remind them of Movement and THE WEEKEND!</li>
  </ul>
