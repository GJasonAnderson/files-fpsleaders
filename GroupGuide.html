  <h1>March Madness: Week 5</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose 1 or 2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What was your biggest take away from the March Madness series?</li>
      <li>How did spending personal time with God go over the past few weeks while in quarantine? Have You done anything differently in your quiet time?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What are some qualities/gifts that you have that are unique to you?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>There are spiritual gifts that God has specifically given you to use in order to show his goodness.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1 Peter 4:10-11</b> As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace: whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies—in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What do you think having a spiritual gift looks like? Maybe give examples of some.</li>
    <li>What spiritual gifts do you think God has blessed you with? Share what gifts you think you have.</li>
    <li>How do you serve other people with these specific gifts? Or how are you not serving others with these gifts?</li>
    <li>How do you think using your gifts can help further the Lord’s kingdom?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you do not know what your God-given gifts are, how can you pinpoint them this week?</li>
    <li>What are three ways this week that you can use your specific gifts to help further God’s kingdom? Quarantine life looks different, but there are still practical ways to love people from home.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests – it is important that your students know that you pray for them regularly!</li>
    <li>Remind them about attending FP online with their family this coming weekend.</li>
    <li>Tell them about all the opportunities they have to connect with FPS during the week on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/fpstudents">@fpstudents</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/fps_pel">@fps_pel</a> – they don’t want to miss out on the fun!</li>  </ul>
