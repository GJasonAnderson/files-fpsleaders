  <h1>Week 1 - The Fire</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How have your first few weeks of school been? Classes, teachers, friends?</li>
      <li>Turn to the person next to you and tell them one high and one low of your week.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever seen a restoration take place? With a car, friend situation, family relationship, etc. What did it look like before the restoration and then what did it look like after the restoration?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Ezekiel 37:4-6</b> <sup>4</sup>Then he said to me, “Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, ‘Dry bones, listen to the word of the Lord! <sup>5</sup>This is what the Sovereign Lord says: Look! I am going to put breath into you and make you live again! <sup></sup>I will put flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.’”</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself wondering if your friendships or family relationships can be restored or revived?</li>
    <li>Does wondering about these specific situations in your life make you feel hopeless? How come?</li>
    <li>If comfortable, what are some things in your life (relationships, school life, home life, physical body or mentally) that need revival and restoration? Why do you need that revival?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What are some ways this week that you can help God be the natural solution while He takes care of the supernatural? Tell them that God wants to use them to speak his words over the broken situations around them and then God will take care of the rest.</li>
    <li>How can you bring restoration in your own life this week?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Baptism Follow-Up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you make a decision to follow Jesus for the first time at Fusion? Or maybe even tonight?</li>
    <li>Have you made that decision sometime in the past but you've never gone public by being baptized?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Baptism is our first official act of obedience as a new Christian and a super easy way to tell the world about your decision. Encourage your students to "seal the deal" and get baptized if they are a follower of Jesus!</p>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
