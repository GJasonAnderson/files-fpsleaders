  <h1>Week 2 - The Fire</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What are your favorite shows to watch on Netflix?</li>
      <li>How did you do last week making steps towards restoration in your life?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Share a story about a time where you saw something you couldn’t explain. Maybe it was a miracle or a strange phenomenon. What happened in that event and how did it change you?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do the natural, and God does the supernatural.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>2 Chronicles 7:12-14</b> <sup>12</sup>Then one night the Lord appeared to Solomon and said, “I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices. <sup></sup>At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues among you. <sup></sup>Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land.</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself being prideful in a situation? How do you think that pride can negatively affect the situation?</li>
    <li>How often do you find yourself praying as a last resort, not a first response to trouble in your life? Why is that?</li>
    <li>If comfortable sharing, is there anyone in this group that has not humbled themselves before the Lord, repented of their sins and asked Jesus into their life?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How are some ways this week you can humble yourself for God so He can do great things through you?</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Baptism Follow-Up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you make a decision to follow Jesus for the first time at Fusion? Or maybe even tonight?</li>
    <li>Have you made that decision sometime in the past but you've never gone public by being baptized?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Baptism is our first official act of obedience as a new Christian and a super easy way to tell the world about your decision. Encourage your students to "seal the deal" and get baptized if they are a follower of Jesus!</p>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
