  <h1><i>At the Movies</i> Week 4</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Who is your favorite super villain and why?</li>
      <li>Why do you think some super villains don’t have any powers? If they don’t have powers how are they so powerful?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>When do you feel the most divided from people? Give examples.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>A house divided can’t stand.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
 
    <ul>
      <li>Ephesians 6:12 KJV "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Who or what are some enemies in your life right now? How often do forget that the real enemy is Satan?</li>
    <li>Who is on your team? (It could be friends, family, and hopefully God) How do these teammates help you grow stronger?</li>
    <li>Do you think that the enemies you have should not be enemies at all? What happens when you’re fighting each other instead of knowing who the true enemy is, Satan?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>What steps can we take this week to create more friends and teammates instead of creating more enemies?</li>
      <li>How can you put back together your divided team this week? Maybe this means mending relationships, saying your sorry to your parents or siblings, or even just forgiving someone that needs to be forgiven.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
