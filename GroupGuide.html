  <h1>Week 5</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>What are you excited about doing this summer?</li>
      <li>What, if any, steps did you take in the last week to further your relationship with Jesus?</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Do you ever feel like you’ve been rooted in rotten soil? (Maybe the people you hang out with or the things you do in your free time?) How do you find yourself out of that?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Jesus is the way to heaven, to truth, and to eternal life.</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>John 15:5 - I am the vine; you are the branches. The one who remains in Me and I in him produces much fruit, because you can do nothing without Me.</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying to you in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>What earthly things do you find yourselves rooted in?</li>
    <li>How often do you find yourself “taping fake fruit” onto your tree of life? Instead of letting what truly lies within you be exposed, you showcase good qualities to others even if they're fake.</li>
    <li>How often do you find yourself practicing things OPPOSITE of the fruit of the spirit? Instead of love, joy, kindness, and self-control you show hate, meanness, and no control.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>How can you bless others this week with the fruit you are producing?</li>
      <li>Encourage students to focus on rooting themselves in healthy soil so that they may have a strong foundation with Jesus.</li>
    </ul>

  <hr>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, be sure to remind them of Movement and THE WEEKEND!</li>
  </ul>
