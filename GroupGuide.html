  <ul>
    <li>Is there a calling from God in your life that youâ€™re ignoring? What is it and why are you ignoring it?</li>
    <li>Have you ever been so scared that you settled for the lesser thing? You were too scared to try out for a sport so you just did it in your own time instead or you were too scared to talk to the new person so you just missed out on an opportunity that could have been great.</li>

      <li>Do you have the faith to be able to ask God to take away your fears so you can start living the fulfilled life He meant you to have?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
