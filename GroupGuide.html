  <h1><i>ALL IN</i> Week 2 - The Word</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How have you grown in your prayer life this past week?</li>
      <li>Did you pray for somebody else this week?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you’re being honest, how often do you actually read the Bible? That could be doing a devotion, listening to the audio Bible, or actually sitting down and reading it word by word. Can you tell a difference in your life when you read more regularly than when you don’t?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus is the word made flesh.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Church Value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We Elevate Those Around Us</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mark 4:13-20</b> Then Jesus said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? How then will you understand any parable? <sup>14</sup>The farmer sows the word. <sup>15</sup>Some people are like seed along the path, where the word is sown. As soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them. <sup>16</sup>Others, like seed sown on rocky places, hear the word and at once receive it with joy. <sup>17</sup>But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away. <sup>18</sup>Still others, like seed sown among thorns, hear the word; <sup>19</sup>but the worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful. <sup>20</sup>Others, like seed sown on good soil, hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop—some thirty, some sixty, some a hundred times what was sown.”</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Which one do you relate to? The seed on the path, rocks, thorns, or good soil?</li>
    <li>What is our seed and how do we make sure we sow/use it well?</li>
    <li>What does it mean when it says seed sown on good soil can produce thirty, sixty, or a hundred times what was sown?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>What steps can you take this week to be in the Word more?</li>
      <li>Start a devotional by downloading the Bible app.</li>
      <li>Set times during the week that you will read the Word and then message your group about what you learned from it.</li>
    </ul>
  

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>Remind your students that tonight is their absolute last chance to register for Fusion – they need to go to <a href="https://fusion.events">fusion.events</a> immediately before the registration window closes tonight at midnight!</li>
  </ul>

  <p><mark><b>Attention All Leaders:</b> We will have a mandatory leader meeting tonight at 7:00 PM in the Chapel while students are in Large Group. We will discuss Fusion rules and expectations, as well as answer all your questions.</mark></p>
