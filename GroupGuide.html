    <p><b>John 1:1-13</b> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <sup>2</sup>He was with God in the beginning. <sup>3</sup>All things were created through him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. <sup>4</sup>In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. <sup>5</sup>That light shines in the darkness, and yet the darkness did not overcome it. <sup>6</sup>There was a man sent from God whose name was John. <sup>7</sup>He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him. <sup>8</sup>He was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. <sup>9</sup>The true light that gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. <sup>10</sup>He was in the world, and the world was created through him, and yet the world did not recognize him. <sup>11</sup>He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. <sup>12</sup>But to all who did receive him, he gave them the right to be children of God, to those who believe in his name <sup>13</sup>who were born, not of natural descent, or of the will of the flesh, or of the will of man, but of God.</p>
