  <h1>Week 3 - The Fire</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What things did you do this week to work on being humble?</li>
      <li>What are some things you love in your life? People, things, sports etc.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Share about a time where you did something you weren’t supposed to do and got in trouble with your parents. How did you explain yourself and what did you say to them?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Love is always the answer.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Isaiah 6:8</b> Then I heard the Lord asking, “Whom should I send as a messenger to this people? Who will go for us?” I said, “Here I am. Send me.”</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you find yourself saying that you hate someone or something? Like “Ugh I hate this teacher because she gives us too much homework.” Do you actually hate them or is it just a meaningless expression at this point? Explain.</li>
    <li>How often do you try to take control of your own life and then it ends up not going good? Explain a time that happened?</li>
    <li>Do you think that every person out there, no matter the bad they’ve done, should have a chance to get into the kingdom of God? Explain why or why not.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can you work on humbly loving everyone this week? Remind them that people are not their enemy because God desires all people to be saved in the kingdom of God.</li>
    <li>Remind students that when they commit their lives to God, He is ultimately in charge. This means they have to move out of the drivers’ seat and let God drive their life while they just have faith.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Baptism Follow-Up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Did you make a decision to follow Jesus for the first time at Fusion? Or maybe even tonight?</li>
    <li>Have you made that decision sometime in the past but you've never gone public by being baptized?</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Baptism is our first official act of obedience as a new Christian and a super easy way to tell the world about your decision. Encourage your students to "seal the deal" and get baptized if they are a follower of Jesus!</p>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
