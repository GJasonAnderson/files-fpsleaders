  <h1><i>ALL IN</i> Week 3 - Breaking of Bread</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you read the Word more this past week?</li>
      <li>How has it made you feel?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How many of you when you have dinner at night actually sit down at a dinner table with your family and talk about the day while you’re eating all together? If you don’t do this, is this something you wish happened? Why or why not?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Jesus is the bread of life.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Church Value</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We Serve Others</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>John 6:26-59</b> Because this is a long passage, we recommend looking it up on the YouVersion app on your phone and using a translation designed around easy readability, like the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/116/JHN.6.NLT">New Living Translation (NLT)</a> for older students or the <a href="https://www.bible.com/bible/110/JHN.6.NIRV">New International Reader’s Version (NIRV)</a> for younger students. You could also have students take turns reading through the passage or read through it in sections.</li>
     <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Have you ever thought something was God but realized it wasn’t?</li>
    <li>How does God demonstrate real love?</li>
    <li>Why do we say “Real people, real problems, real love”?</li>
    <li>What do you think your God given purpose is?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
      <li>How can I depend on Jesus when I come face to face with the things I struggle with? How do I make Him the bread of my life?</li>
      <li>Take practical steps to realize your purpose and potential.</li>
      <li>Am I willing to be broken in order to be made whole?</li>
    </ul>
  

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>Remind your students that Fusion starts on Friday night – they need to meet at your host home at 6:30 PM.</li>
  </ul>
