  <h1>March Madness: Week 3</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose 1 or 2)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>What sermon(s) did you connect with most this week?</li>
      <li>In what ways do you think we can grow while we are stuck at home and many of our usual distractions are gone?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever had to make a sacrifice for something or someone? Explain a time.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Spending time with God in prayer, worship, and Bible reading is a sacrifice that needs to be made for God.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Matthew 6:33</b> But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How often do you spend time with God? Whether its bible reading, worshiping, or prayer.</li>
    <li>Would you say you have a strong personal relationship with Jesus? Maybe explain what your personal relationship with God looks like.</li>
    <li>Do you often prioritize other things in your life over Jesus? Have them explain what their true priorities are.</li>
    <li>How do you think having other things over God makes him feel?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>
  <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>How can you take your first step to giving up something that is put over God?</li>
    <li>What are some ways that you can prioritize your relationship with God this week? Guide them to a Bible reading plan if they feel lost or overwhelmed with the Bible. Encourage them to be accountable to each other so they can grow stronger together and with God.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests – it is important that your students know that you pray for them regularly!</li>
    <li>Remind them about attending FP online with their family this coming weekend.</li>
    <li>Tell them about all the opportunities we have to connect with FPS during the week on Instagram <a href="https://instagram.com/fpstudents">@fpstudents</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/fps_pel">@fps_pel</a> – they don’t want to miss out on the fun!</li>
