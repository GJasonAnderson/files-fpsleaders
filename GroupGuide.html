  <h1><i>At the Movies</i> Week 1</h1>

  <h2>Life / Intro Questions (Choose one or two)</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>High School Groups - What movie were the clips from? Do you like that movie?</li>
      <li>Middle School Groups - Take a guess on what different movies they’re going to play throughout the series.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Connection Question</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Have you ever felt unqualified? Maybe those around you are better equipped for something than you? Share a story of when this happened.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Sermon in a Sentence</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>God does not call the equipped, he equips the called.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
 
    <ul>
      <li><b>2 Corinthians 3:5</b> It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own. Our qualification comes from God.</li>
      <li>What is Jesus saying in this scripture?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Do you ever not feel qualified for something? Maybe because you’re too young, uneducated, and too dependent? Give examples.</li>
    <li>How many of you play sports or are involved in something with a group? How often do you find yourself following your teammates more than God? Explain a time.</li>
    <li>Do you think that God can call you to do great things before you’re equipped with the ability to do those great things?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Life Application</h2>

    <p>We want students walking away with 1 or 2 things they are going to do SOON to apply what they discussed.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Right now in your life, what do you think God has called you to do?</li>
      <li>How can you faithfully trust that God will equip you so you can live out His calling this week?</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Take It Out</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests.</li>
    <li>After prayer, remind them of THE WEEKEND and any upcoming group events!</li>
  </ul>
