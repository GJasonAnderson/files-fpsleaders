  <ul>
    <li>What are some things that keep you away from finding your identity in Jesus? (Friends, people’s opinions about you, social media?) How come?
    </li>
    <li>What are some steps this week that you can take to be able to find your identity in Jesus alone?</li>
    <li>Who do have to keep you accountable this week for your spiritual growth? If they do not have an accountability partner or do not know what that means, explain and encourage them to find one so they can grow spiritually.</li>

    <li>Close small group out with prayer requests – it is important that your students know that you pray for them regularly!</li>
